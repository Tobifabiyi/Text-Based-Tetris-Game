# Text-Based Tetris Game

The Text-Based Tetris Game is a command-line implementation of the classic puzzle game, Tetris. It allows players to control falling tetrominoes and clear lines to earn points. The objective is to achieve a high score by clearing as many lines as possible.

## Features

- Game Board: The game board is a grid-based field where tetrominoes fall. It displays the current state of the game, including the falling tetromino, stack of placed tetrominoes, and score.
- Tetromino Shapes: Different tetromino shapes, such as L, T, I, and more, descend from the top of the game board. Players can rotate and move them horizontally to fit into the stack.
- Line Clearing: When a row is completely filled with tetrominoes, it clears the row, and any rows above it move down to fill the empty space. Cleared lines contribute to the player's score.
- Scoring: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of lines cleared. The score increases as multiple lines are cleared simultaneously, earning higher points.
- Game Over: The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the game board, and there is no more space for new pieces to fall.
- Controls: Players can control the falling tetrominoes using keyboard inputs. Common controls include arrow keys for movement and rotation.

7. When a line is filled completely, it will be cleared, and your score will increase.
8. Continue playing and strive to achieve the highest score by clearing as many lines as possible.
9. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the game board.
